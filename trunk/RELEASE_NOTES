A bug was found in msformat.cpp and this has been fixed.  Also, for complicated population joining and splitting events, event times need to reflect a unique order.  Very close times should be mathematically close enough (e.g. for two events of the same time 0.00011 vs 0.00012 if .000105 was the intended time).  Note that when migration and split event proportions are small that there may be insufficient chromosomes to execute the event.  User friendlier messages are now added when an exception is thrown.

I have added a change to the output of segregating sites to support listing of the age of mutations.  This is the third column, preceding the column of bits representing the mutations across all haplotypes.  The msformat.cpp parser has been updated to accommodate this change.

Stephan Schiffels gratefully fixed a bug in which precision of tree length would progressively degrade as trees were sampled from left to right on the chromosome.

Thanks to Etienne Patin for pointing out a bug where SNP ascertainment failed when more than one simulation iteration was requested.  The bug is now fixed.  Vincenza Colonna pointed out discrepancies in the information headers regarding population IDs.  The headers now refer to populations as 1-indexed wheras previously some 0-indexed pop IDs were printed to screen. Note that users should refer to populations using 1-indexed pop IDs.

Thanks to Vincenza Colonna for spotting an inconsistency between what the command line parameters for pop IDs are echoed to screen and how they are specified by the user.

Thanks to Ni Huang and Vincenza Colonna for spotting and fixing a bug in the command line parser, so that the program will support negative values in parameter arguments, and not confuse these are new options.
