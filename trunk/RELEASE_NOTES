Thanks to Etienne Patin for pointing out a bug where SNP ascertainment failed when more than one simulation iteration was requested.  The bug is now fixed.  Vincenza Colonna pointed out discrepancies in the information headers regarding population IDs.  The headers now refer to populations as 1-indexed wheras previously some 0-indexed pop IDs were printed to screen. Note that users should refer to populations using 1-indexed pop IDs.

Thanks to Vincenza Colonna for spotting an inconsistency between what the command line parameters for pop IDs are echoed to screen and how they are specified by the user.

Thanks to Ni Huang and Vincenza Colonna for spotting and fixing a bug in the command line parser, so that the program will support negative values in parameter arguments, and not confuse these are new options.
